        Actually, model compression is a kind of technique for developing portable deep neural networks with lower memory and computation costs. I have done several projects in Huawei including some smartphones' applications in 2019 and 2020 (e.g. Mate 30 and Honor V30). Currently, I am leading the AdderNet project, which aims to develop a series of deep learning models using only additions (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ekw2s1/r_addernet_do_we_really_need_multiplications_in/">Discussions on Reddit</a>).

        I would like to say, <span style="color:red">AdderNet is very cool!</span> The initial idea was came up in about 2017 when climbing with some friends at Beijing. By replacing all convolutional layers (except the first and the last layers), we now can obtain comparable performance on ResNet architectures. In addition, to make the story more complete, we recent release the hardware implementation and some quantization methods. The results are quite encouraging, we can reduce both <strong>the energy consumption and thecircuit areas significantly without affecting the performance</strong>. Now, we are working on more applications to reduce the costs of launching AI algorithms such as low-level vision, detection, and NLP tasks.

        The initial verison of GhostNet was accepted by CVPR 2020, which achieved SOTA performance on ImageNet: <span style="color:red">75.7%</span> top1 acc with only <span style="color:red">226M FLOPS</span>. In the current version, we release a series computer vision models (e.g. int8 quantization, detection, and larger networks) on <strong>MindsSpore 1.0</strong> and <strong>Mate 30 Pro (Kirin 990)</strong>.

        This project aims to develop a video style transfer system on the <strong>Huawei Atlas 200 DK AI developer Kit</strong>. The latency of the original model for processing one image is about <span style="color:red">630ms</span>. After accelerating it using our method, the lantency now is about <span style="color:red">40ms</span>.
